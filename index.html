                <p class="project-description">
                    Breaking Boundaries is a physic-based game made in Unity where players swing
                    around a ball to ride curves and build up speed, aiming to break out of the map.
                    This game won 10th Place Overall at the Foddian SpeedJam #2 using the theme of
                    "momentum" and was the 4th most popular game at the time of judging. I worked
                    as a project manager and technical game designer in a team of four where I
                    pitched and designed the idea of the game to my team, defined and distributed
                    tasks, and personally implemented the game's physics system and controls.

                <p class="project-description">
                    SpaceFist is a 2D fighting game made in Unity with a fusion of platform fighter gameplay and sumo wrestling rules.
                    This was a semester long project for my Game Development class at Texas A&amp;M as part of a team of seven.
                    As a technical game designer, I was personally responsible for designing the movesets and unique mechanics
                    of each character and implementing the movement and knockback systems in a manner that is scalable for new
                    moves and characters.

                <p class="project-description">
                    Painta and the Slime Mix-Up is a top-down shooter made in Unity where players defeat
                    enemies by shooting them with different colors to mix them into powerful
                    effects. This game won 2nd Place Overall at the 2022 Chillennium Game Jam
                    and was created in 48 hours for the theme of "You really shouldn't mix
                    those!" I worked as a technical game designer in a team of four where I
                    both pitched and designed the idea of the game to my team and implemented
                    the color mixing mechanics, enemy spawning logic, UI functionality, and
                    enemy AI.
